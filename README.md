# brackets-model

The types needed by brackets-manager.js and brackets-viewer.js

If you think any class or property should not be here, it's likely that you think about only one of the two libraries... ðŸ˜‰

## Disclaimer

This package has no functionality. It's **just type definitions**.

However, it's used by those 2 packages:

- [brackets-manager.js](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-manager.js)
- [brackets-viewer.js](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-viewer.js)
