# brackets-model

The types needed by [brackets-manager.js](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-manager.js) and [brackets-viewer.js](https://github.com/Drarig29/brackets-viewer.js)

If you think any type or property should not be here, it's likely you think about only one of the two libraries... ðŸ˜‰
